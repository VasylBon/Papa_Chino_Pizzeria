"Papa Chino Pizzeria" - is my personal project developed for the Papa Chino pizzeria. As part of this project, I fully developed the interface design in Figma and brought it to life by creating a responsive website based on the developed layout.

The main functionalities of the website include:

1. Display of the product range: Users can familiarize themselves with the various types of pizza and other products offered by Papa Chino.
2. Change of the website language: The site supports the ability to change the language to ensure comfortable navigation for different audiences.
3. Adding products to the cart: Users can easily add products to their cart for further checkout.
4. Cart editing: Users have the ability to view and edit the contents of their cart before checkout.
5. Feedback forms: The site contains three forms for users: a form for leaving feedback, a form for questions, and a form for placing an order. All fields of these forms are subject to instant validation to ensure that the data is entered correctly.
6. Forms processing: PHP is used to process the data from the forms. The information entered by users in the forms is processed and, if successfully entered, stored in the database.

This project allows Papa Chino's customers to easily order their favorite pizza and leave feedback, providing a convenient and efficient online platform for interacting with the pizzeria.
